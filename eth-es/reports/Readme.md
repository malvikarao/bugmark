This code can do two things:

1. It can pull transactions from the rails app, post the transactions to rinkeby, and push a url to the rails app
2. It can makes human-readable spreadsheets and text files out of blockchain data.

To pull transactions, post to rinkeby, and push a url to the rails app

1. Make sure your truffle environment is set up to work with a synced rinkeby node (unlocked, plenty of eth, truffle tests all pass)
2. Run download_events.sh to grab all the transactions generated by the rails app
3. Run python pull_event.py to post the transaction data to rinkeby and urls to the rails app

To make a spreadsheet: (This does not work properly ATM)

You need python, perl, ethabi.  An etherscan.io account is recommended.  On ubuntu, I used the rust version of ethabi from parity.

1. Run download_txns.sh - that will grab the contract transactions from etherscan.io
2. Run python ./decoder.py - that will convert the downloaded json into the fields we want into human readable plain text
3. Run make_csv.sh - that will make csv files.
4. Use in your favorite spreadsheet reader
