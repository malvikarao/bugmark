  h3 What is this?
  p Bugmark is a market that connects people who want better software to the
    people who can build it.
  p In order to make open collabration more effective, we use simple
    market mechanisms to add incentives to do useful work.
  h3 Bugmark allows you to
  ol
    li Put financial value directly in the hands of the people who can fix
       the software issues that are most important to you.
    li Discover which issues really matter to your project’s users.
    li Work with open source practices and not against them. Solve part of a
       problem and still get paid, instead of contending to claim credit for a
       bounty payment.
  h3 Find an issue, fix it, and earn money
  p Vist Bugmark to find an open issue that matches your skills and
    interests. Buy a futures contract connected to that issue that will pay
    you when the issue is fixed. Work on the issue in the open.  Then decide
    if you want to hold your contract until maturity, or sell it at a profit.
  h3 Trackerrt an issue and pay to reward others to fix it
  p Create a new issue on the project bug tracker, or select an existing
    one. Buy a futures contract on that issue that will cost you a known
    amount when the issue is fixed, or pay you to compensate you if the issue
    goes unfixed. Reduce your exposure to software risks by directly signaling
    the project participants about what issues are important to you.
  h3 Invest in futures on an open source market
  p Development isn’t the only task required to make a software project a
    success. You can trade futures to earn a profit from other vital tasks,
    such as clarifying and translating bug trackerrts, triaging bugs, writing
    failing tests, or doing code reviews.
